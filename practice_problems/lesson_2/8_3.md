```js
var basket = 'empty';

function goShopping() {
  function shop1() {
    basket = 'tv';
  }

  console.log(basket); // empty

  function shop2() {
    basket = 'computer';
  }

  function shop3() {
    var basket = 'play station';
    console.log(basket); // play station
  }

  shop1();
  shop2();
  shop3();

  console.log(basket); // computer
}

goShopping();
```

This logs:

```
empty
play station
computer
```

The first `console.log(basket)` occurs while `basket` still has its original value, `'empty'`.

The function call `shop1()` changes `basket` to `'tv'` and the function call `shop2()` changes `basket` to `'computer'`.

Within the function call `shop3()`, a new local variable `basket` is defined, with a value of `'play station'`. It's this variable that is output by the `console.log(basket)`.

Upon returning from `shop3()`, the local variable goes away, and the last `console.log(basket)` outputs the global variable `basket`, now with a value of `'computer'`.
