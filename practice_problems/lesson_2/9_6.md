```js
var a = 'outer';
var b = 'outer';

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
setScope(a);
console.log(a);
console.log(b);

function setScope(foo) {
  foo = 'inner';
  b = 'inner';
}
```

This outputs:

```
outer
outer
outer
inner
```

Function argumentS become local variables within a function, so assigning to an argument has no effect on the original argument. This explains why `a` remains unchanged.

However, as `b` is directly referenced within `setScope()`, it's reassigned to `'inner'`.
