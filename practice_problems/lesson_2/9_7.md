```js
var total = 50;
var increment = 15;

function incrementBy(increment) {
  total += increment;
}

console.log(total);
incrementBy(10);
console.log(total);
console.log(increment);
```

Output:

```
50
60
15
```

Although the function parameter `increment` has the same name as the variable declared on line 2, they are not the same variable. Function arguments are locally scoped variables, therefore the `increment`'s value remains unchanged and 15 is output.
