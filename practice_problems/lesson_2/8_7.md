```js
console.log(a);

function hello() {
  a = 1;
}
``` 

After hoisting, this program is equivalent to:

```js
function hello() {
  a = 1;
}

console.log(a);
```

`a` is declared and defined within the `hello()` function.

However, as `hello()` is never invoked, `a` is never declared, therefore `console.log(a)` raised an `Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined`.
