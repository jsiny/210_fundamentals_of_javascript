```js
function hello() {
  var a = 'hello';
}

hello();
console.log(a);
```

The `hello()` function call declares a local `a` variable with a value of `'hello'`.

However, as it's a local variable, `a` is not available from outside the `hello()` function, and this program therefore raises an `Uncaught ReferenceError` as `a is not defined`.
