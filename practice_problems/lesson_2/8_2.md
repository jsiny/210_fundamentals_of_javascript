```js
var a = 'outer';

function testScope() {
  a = 'inner';
  console.log(a);
}

console.log(a); // outer
testScope();    // inner
console.log(a); // inner
```

As `a` is defined as a global variable (no `var` keyword preceding its declaration), it has global scope and the last `console.log(a)` call also resolves as the global variable `a` with a value of `'inner'`.
