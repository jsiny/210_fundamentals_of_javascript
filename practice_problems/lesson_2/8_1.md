```js
var a = 'outer';

function testScope() {
  var a = 'inner';
  console.log(a);
}

console.log(a); // 'outer'
testScope();    // 'inner
console.log(a); // 'outer'
```

The first `console.log(a)` calls the global variable `a`, with a value of `'outer'`.

Then, the `testScope` function is called, where `a` resolves as a local variable with a value of `'inner'`.

After `testScope` returns, the last `console.log(a)` resolves as the (unchanged) global variable, with a value of `'outer'`.
