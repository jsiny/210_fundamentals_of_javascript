```js
var a = 1;

function foo() {
  a = 2;
  function bar() {
    a = 3;
    return 4;
  }

  return bar();
}

console.log(foo());
console.log(a);
```

Output:

```
4
3
```

The invokation of the `foo()` method has the following effects:
- the `a` variable defined in the main scope is reassigned to 2
- the function `bar()` is called
- the same `a` variable is reassigned to 3
- the value `4` is returned. 

Then, when `console.log(a)` is called, it outputs the last assigned value, ie. `3`.
