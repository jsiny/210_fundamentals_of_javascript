```js
function hello() {
  a = 'hello';
}

hello();
console.log(a); // hello
```

Within the `hello()` function, the global variable `a` is declared and assigned to the value `'hello'`. 

As it has global scope, this `a` variable is accessible outside of the `hello()` function and is therefore output by `console.log(a)`.
