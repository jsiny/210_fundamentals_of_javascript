```js
var a = 'global';

function checkScope() {
  var a = 'local';
  function nested() {
    var a = 'nested';
    function superNested() {
      a = 'superNested';
      return a;
    }

    return superNested();
  }

  return nested();
}

console.log(checkScope());
console.log(a);
```

Output:
```
superNested
global
```

Let's detail the execution of the program:

- On line 1, the global scope variable `a` is declared and assigned the value `'global'`.
- On line 18, `checkScope()` is called.
- Within `checkScope()`, the local variable `a` is declared and assigned the value `'local'`.
- The function `nested()` is called
- Within `nested()`, the local variable `a` is declared and assigned the value `'nested'`.
- The function `superNested()` is called.
- Within `superNested()`, the variable `a` is reassigned to `superNested`. But which variable `a`? Because of variable shadowing, the reassigned variable is the first one available, ie. the `a` variable declared within `nested()`.

Therefore, the value `superNested` is returned from the `checkScope()` call, and `console.log(a)` outputs `global`, as the global scope `a` is unchanged.
