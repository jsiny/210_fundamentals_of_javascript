```js
function someFunction() {
  myVar = 'This is global';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);
```

Output:

```
This is global
```

The important part here is the fact that there is no variable declaration for `myVar`, ie. there is no `var` keyword.

As such, JabaScript binds `myVar` to be a property of the global object - almost as if the variable was globally declared.

When `someFunction()` is called, the global `myVar` is assigned the value `'This is global'` - and therefore this value is output by `console.log(myVar)`.
