```js
var a = 7;

function myValue(b) {
  b += 10;
}

myValue(a);
console.log(a);
```

Output: 

```
7
```

Numbers are immutable values in JavaScript. Therefore, passing `a` (assigned to 7) to a function as an argument cannot result in `a` pointing to a different value, regardless of this function's return value.
