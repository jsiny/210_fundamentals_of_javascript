```js
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  console.log(myVar);
}

someFunction();
```

Output: 

```
This is global
```

The global variable `myVar` is declared on line 1 and assigned to the value `'This is global'`.

Then, the function `someFunction()` is called. Within it, `console.log(myVar)` is called.

`myVar` is accessible within this inner scope because it was defined with a global scope - and globally scoped variables are accessible from within inner scopes.
