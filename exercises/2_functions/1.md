```js
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  var myVar = 'This is local';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);
```

This program outputs `This is global`.

The `someFunction()` call declares a local variable `myVar` which is only available within the function scope. 

As such, it does not impact the global scope `myVar` variable declared on line 1.
