```js
console.log(a);

var a = 1;
```

Output:

```
undefined
```

After hoisting, the above program is equivalent to:

```js
var a;
console.log(a);
a = 1;
```

Therefore, when `console.log(a)` is called, `a` has already been declared but no value has been assigned to it - therefore `undefined` is displayed.
