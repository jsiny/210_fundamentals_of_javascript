```js
let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);
```

This code outputs `1`.
`foo` doesn't affect the value assigned to `bar` on line 1 since JS functions create an inner scope. Thus, the `bar` variable on line 3 does not refer to the same variable as the one on line 1.
