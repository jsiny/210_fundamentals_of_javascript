```js
const FOO = 'bar';
{
  const FOO = 'qux';
}

console.log(FOO);
```

This program does not raise an error, because Constants have the same scoping rules as variables declared with `let`. Therefore, the second `const FOO` declares a new constant, within the scope of the block, that shadows the  main constant.
