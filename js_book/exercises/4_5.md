```js
let foo = 'bar';
{
  let foo = 'qux';
}

console.log(foo);
```

This code snippet outputs `'bar'`, because:
- the `foo` variable is first initialized with a main scope,
- then, within the block, a new variable with the same name `foo` is initialized, shadowing the main `foo`.
- however, that second variable is out of scope  in the main, where `console.log(foo);` is called. Therefore, `"bar"` is printed.
