```js
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1;
arr1[1] = 4;
console.log(arr2);
```

This program outputs `[1, 4, 3]` because:
- as `arr2` is initialized as `arr1`, both `arr1` and `arr2` point to the same array
- `arr1[4]` mutates the second element of that array. This change impacts `arr2` because they both refer to the same array.
