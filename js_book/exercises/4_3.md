```js
> { let foo = 'bar'; }
undefined
> foo
Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
```

The `foo` variable is initiliazed within a block (between the `{}`) and therefore its variable scope is within that block. It can't be referenced outside of it. Therefore, when it is, an error is raised, telling us that `foo` is not defined.
