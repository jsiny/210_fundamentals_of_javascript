```js
const NAME = 'Victor';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

NAME = 'Joe';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);
``` 

This program first outputs this: 

```
Good Morning, Victor.
Good Afternoon, Victor.
Good Evening, Victor.
```

Then, it raises an TypeError as `NAME` is a constant and as such, cannot be reassigned to another value.

Finally, the same three sentences are printed, with `NAME` still referencing `"Victor"`:

```
Good Morning, Victor.
Good Afternoon, Victor.
Good Evening, Victor.
```
