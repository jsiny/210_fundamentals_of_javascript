```js
var a = [1, 2, 3];

function myValue(b) {
  b[2] += 7;
}

myValue(a);
console.log(a);
```

Output:

```
[1, 2, 10]
```

Arrays (like other JS objects) are mutable.

When the value assigned to `a` is passed to `myValue()`, a local variable `b` is initialized, poiting to the same array that `a` references.

Therefore, when the program executes the reassignment `b += 7`, it actually does so on the global scope array `a`.

Therefore, it's the mutated array that gets output.
