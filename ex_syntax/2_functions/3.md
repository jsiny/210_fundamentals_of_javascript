```js
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  myVar = 'This is local';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);
```

Output:

```
This is local
```

This program only has one variable declaration, so there is only one `myVar` variable instead of two.

The global scope variable `myVar` is declared on line 1 and assigned to the value `'This is global'`.

Then, the function `someFunction()` is called and within it, the global var `myVar` is reassigned to the value `'This is local'`. This is possible because variables in the global scope can be accessed and modified within an inner scope.

As such, this is this last value that is output by the program through `console.log(myVar)`.
