```js
var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  var myVar = 'This is local';
  console.log(myVar);
}

someFunction();
```

This program outputs `This is local` because the `console.log(myVar)` call is within the function `someFunction()`, where the local scope `myVar` variable has been declared and assigned to the value `'This is local'`.

The global scope `myVar` is not accessible from within `someFunction()` because of variable shadowing.
